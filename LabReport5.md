### Student Question

![image](assets/TheCode.png)

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

Mac, M1, eclipse, junit

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

The code is returning 10 when it should be returning 13 for the heap. The input in the method is the 4th largest value.

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**

I'm running the bash command to run the file. I'm trying to run the file which should be working with bash but it cannot run
